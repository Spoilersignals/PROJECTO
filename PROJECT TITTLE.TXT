Project Title
Smart Wi-Fi Bound Prompt-Based Class Attendance System

Project Overview
In many academic settings, traditional class attendance methods such as manual roll calls are inefficient, time-consuming, and susceptible to misuse—especially proxy attendance. Advanced alternatives like biometric systems are expensive and impractical for resource-constrained institutions or large class sizes.

This project introduces a smartphone-based attendance system that leverages the institution’s Wi-Fi infrastructure to confirm student presence in class. By generating a time-limited attendance prompt, only students physically connected to the authorized Wi-Fi network can mark themselves present, thus ensuring a location-bound, hardware-free, and efficient attendance-taking process.

Objectives
To develop a secure and easy-to-use attendance system accessible via student smartphones.

To ensure attendance marking is bound to physical class presence using Wi-Fi verification.

To automate attendance reporting and reduce administrative workload.

To prevent proxy submissions and promote academic integrity.

Key Actors and Roles
Lecturer

Initiates attendance sessions for specific classes.

Downloads or views attendance reports in real time.

Student

Connects to the institution Wi-Fi and marks attendance using their registration number during a valid session.

Administrator

Manages accounts, monitors logs, manages course-session associations, and ensures data integrity.

Key Features
Lecturer can create one-time prompt valid for 2–3 minutes.

Students must be connected to the institutional Wi-Fi to respond.

Attendance is recorded using registration number, timestamp, and IP address.

One submission per student per session is enforced.

Attendance logs are exportable in Excel or PDF format.

Admin dashboard for monitoring and reporting.

Functional Requirements
User Registration and Role Assignment

Secure sign-up/login using email or institutional credentials.

Roles include student, lecturer, and admin.

Prompt Generation and Expiry

Lecturer creates a one-time attendance prompt tied to a class session.

Prompt expires automatically after a set time.

Wi-Fi Range Verification

System verifies the IP address matches the institutional network range.

Only eligible devices are granted access to the attendance form.

Attendance Logging

Students submit registration number once.

System logs timestamp, session ID, IP address, and status.

Duplicate Prevention and Session Locking

Each student can only respond once per session.

After expiry, further submissions are rejected.

Report Generation

Admin and lecturers can export attendance data by date, session, or student.

Non-Functional Requirements
Security: All data must be transmitted over HTTPS with JWT authentication.

Performance: The system should handle 100+ concurrent submissions under 1 second per response.

Scalability: Must support multiple institutions, campuses, classes, and thousands of users.

Availability: The system must be reliable during class periods with at least 99% uptime.

Maintainability: Codebase should be modular, well-commented, and documented.

Usability: Intuitive interface for non-technical users with responsive design for phones and desktops.

Technology Stack
Frontend: React.js or Vue.js for responsive user interface

Backend: Django (Python) or Node.js (Express) for business logic and session handling

Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing attendance records, sessions, and user data

Authentication: Firebase Auth or custom JWT-based system

Network Verification: IP range matching and SSID checking

Deployment: Heroku, AWS, or Firebase Hosting

Reporting: Excel/PDF generation using libraries like ReportLab or SheetJS

Project Delivery Requirements
Technical Requirements
Institutional Wi-Fi with identifiable IP address range (for validation)

Domain name and SSL certificate for secure deployment

Cloud-based hosting environment (e.g., Firebase, AWS, or Heroku)

Access to real-time database or SQL server for persistent storage

Email or Google login integration for user authentication

Testing devices (Android/iOS smartphones, laptops)

Human Resource Requirements
Frontend Developer (React.js or Flutter Web experience)

Backend Developer (Django or Node.js expertise)

UI/UX Designer (for designing a clean, responsive interface)

System Tester (to conduct QA during beta testing)

Project Manager (to coordinate milestones, deliverables, and communication)

Logistical and Institutional Requirements
Access to course and user enrollment data (registration numbers, roles)

Institutional approval to access Wi-Fi IP ranges

Pilot classes or instructors for beta testing

Feedback loop from lecturers and students for iterative improvement

Deployment approval from institution’s IT department (if internal hosting is needed
