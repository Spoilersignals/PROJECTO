# Physical Security Guide

The **Visual Verification System** addresses the "Phone Muling" problem (where one student brings multiple phones to class).

## The Problem
Software cannot easily detect if one person is holding two phones. A student might bring their friend's phone to class to mark attendance for them.

## The Solution: Live Visual Verification

After a student successfully marks attendance, their screen transforms into a **Live Verification Card**.

### How it works:
1.  **Live Ticking Clock**: Shows the current second. Prevents using static screenshots.
2.  **Color Shifting**: The background color slowly shifts (Green -> Blue -> Purple). This makes it easy for a lecturer to scan the room and see if everyone's screen matches.
3.  **Pulsing Indicator**: A "LIVE VERIFICATION" badge pulses to further prevent video playback/screenshots.
4.  **Student Details**: Clearly shows Name and Reg Number.

### Lecturer Procedure
To catch students with multiple phones:

1.  **"Show me your screens!"**: Ask the class to hold up their phones after marking attendance.
2.  **Look for duplicates**: It is very physically awkward to hold two phones up clearly.
3.  **Look for wrong colors/static images**: If someone is using a screenshot, the time won't tick and the color won't shift in sync with others (roughly).

### Combined Protection Layer
1.  **Network**: Must be on Classroom WiFi.
2.  **Location**: Must be in the room.
3.  **Device Binding**: Cannot log out and log in as friend on same phone.
4.  **Visual Verification**: Cannot easily hold multiple phones unnoticed.
